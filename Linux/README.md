# GitConfig for linux

## Installing

If you want to use the installer you can run this terminal command while in this folder

```bash
chmod +x ./Install.sh && ./Install.sh
```

If you don't want to use the installer, you can place the conf file inside `~/bin` and give it executable permissions with `chmod +x ~/bin/conf`.

*PSA: Don't run random install scripts from the internet without checking them out first

## Using it

In your terminal run `conf` with no arguments to get started. You can check the main README for more info.
