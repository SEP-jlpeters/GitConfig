# GitConfig for Windows

## Installing

Right click on `Install.ps1` and click `Run with PowerShell`. If you can't run it due to signing, open a terminal in this folder and run the following command and try again.

```Powershell
Unblock-File -Path ".\Install.ps1"
```

*PSA: Don't run random install scripts from the internet without checking them out first

## Using it

In your terminal run `conf` with no arguments to get started. You can check the main README for more info.
